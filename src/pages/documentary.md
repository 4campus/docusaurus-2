## Synopsis

In the spring of 2023, the campus of *North Carolina State University* witnessed its 14th student death within a single academic year. Following the haze of COVID-19 and the "forced" pandemic lockdowns, a team of rogue missionaries set out to discover why this tragic phenomenon occurred, the root issues plaguing the college campus, and what they planned to do about it.
