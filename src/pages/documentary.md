In the spring of 2023, the campus of North Carolina State University witnessed its 14th student death within a single academic year. Following the haze of COVID-19 and the "forced" pandemic lockdowns, a team of rogue missionaries set out to discover why this tragic phenomenon occurred, the root issues plaguing the college campus, and what they planned to do about it.

*"I want to listen"* is a full-length audio-documentary exploring the real voices of students, community leaders, and thought experts on issues surrounding mental health, spirituality, and their lasting effects on today's youth and culture.
