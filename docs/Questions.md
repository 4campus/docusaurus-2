Here are some of the top questions students ask, including their answers according to the Bible.

### **01 Is the Bible factual?**
Would it surprise you to know that the books of the Bible are the most analyzed, researched, and **historically reliable** documents ever recorded? In fact, there are nearly 6,000 surviving manuscripts of the New Testament alone, with the closest competitor being Homer’s *The Iliad*, which has only 600 existing copies (see [article](https://reasonabletheology.org/reliability-bible-4-quick-thoughts/)). Even more astonishing is the foretelling—prophesying—of future events with remarkable accuracy and clarity, such as the birth and exile of a Jewish nation, to the life, death, and resurrection of a Messiah, **perfectly fulfilled** in Jesus of Nazareth (see [reference chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4campus/docusaurus-2/main/static/docs/OldTestamentPropheciesofJesus.pdf)).

### **02 Does God exist?**
Before the world and universe came into existence, there had to be an **uncaused cause**. The very fact we exist on a ball of liquid and solid iron, suspended in space, and spinning 1000 miles per hour is evidence there are forces at play that far exceed our own understanding. The Bible states that "In the beginning was the Word... and the Word was God" ([John 1:1](https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm)). When God spoke to Moses—a revered Jewish leader in history—He states, "I AM WHO I AM" ([Exodus 3:14](https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-14.htm)). No matter how we think about it, there's simply no denying something or **Someone greater** is working for our good behind nature.

### **03 Was Jesus God?**
There are many examples in the Bible that point to Jesus as God. He was foretold by ancient prophets as the Messiah, or "God-man" ([Psalm 22](https://biblehub.com/niv/psalms/22.htm); [Isaiah 53](https://biblehub.com/niv/isaiah/53.htm)), thousands of years before his birth. While on earth he **performed miracles** that defied physics and logic, but more importantly—unquestionably the most substantial—Jesus was **crucified** and **rose from the dead** after three days ([Matthew 28:1-10](https://biblehub.com/niv/matthew/28.htm); [Mark 16:1-8](https://biblehub.com/niv/mark/16.htm); [Luke 24:1-10](https://biblehub.com/niv/luke/24.htm); [John 20:1-18](https://biblehub.com/niv/john/20.htm)). Today, billions of people around the world believe in a literal historical Jesus—including some [agnostic scholars](https://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2012/0703/Biblical-scholar-Bart-Ehrman-supports-the-historic-existence-of-Jesus)—but the real challenge is, will they follow His teachings to the end?

### **04 Is God just?**
This is one of the most challenging questions students ask. In one example regarding God's **justice** we read that "Vengeance is Mine; I will repay" ([Deuteronomy 32:35](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-35.htm)), while in another book it states, "The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love" ([Psalms 103:8](https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-8.htm)). Jesus perfectly embodies the law God established, and can therefore respond to his accusers **without contradiction**—"You have heard that it was said, ‘*Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.*’ But I tell you, do not resist an evil person... **love your enemies** and pray for those who persecute you" ([Matthew 5:38](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-38.htm),[44](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-44.htm)).

### **05 Aren't all religions fundamentally the same?**
The saying often goes, "there are many paths to get to heaven" [or truth, or reason, etc.]. With all the established religions and their respective gods, how can we know for sure that any of them are more true or superior to others? In Luke's record of the *Acts of the Apostles*, he states of Jesus that "*Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved*" ([Acts 4:12](https://biblehub.com/acts/4-12.htm)). Moreover, Jesus repeatedly referred to himself as being "*One*" with the Father/Creator ([John 1:1](https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm); [John 10:30](https://biblehub.com/john/10-30.htm), [John 8:58](https://biblehub.com/john/8-58.htm)). An important question to ask is why haven't the other prophets of major religions made these same claims? If they have, how did they demonstrate it, and by what standard of truth can we compare it to?

### **06 Why do people suffer?**
Contrary to popular teaching, the root of all evil is not money, but rather **selfishness**. In the beginning, **sin**—separation from God—entered man's heart through our foreparents, Adam and Eve ([Genesis 3:1-6](https://biblehub.com/niv/genesis/3.htm)). It was their [transgression](https://biblehub.com/topical/t/transgression.htm) by violating God's command (seeking to elevate themselves to His level) which led humanity to the kind of **suffering and injustice** witnessed throughout time. God responds to our fallen state by sacrificing Himself in the form of His son, Jesus, who takes the place of all our sins—past, present, future—so we may have everlasting life back with Him ([Colossians 2:13-14](https://biblehub.com/niv/colossians/2.htm)).

### **07 Isn't truth relative?**
We rely on **natural laws** to govern societies and protect the innocent, just as we depend on gravity and "unseen forces" to keep our feet firmly planted on the ground. However, much of **post-modern culture** reflects a highly *subjective* and "feelings-based" approach toward truth and reality. According to Aristotle's [*Principle of Non-Contradiction*](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-noncontradiction/), one set of contradictory statements cannot be both equally true and equally false at the same time (see [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLl7TRF_l2w)). The Bible instead speaks of a God who is both unchanging—immutable—and eternally consistent, "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever... Through him all things were made" ([Hebrews 13:8](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-8.htm); [John 1:3](https://biblehub.com/john/1-3.htm)).

### **08 Is LGBTQA+ lifestyle acceptable?**
**(What if they love Jesus?)**
The issue of a person's lifestyle, or sexuality, has long been a topic of contention. The Bible states that "God created man in His own image... **male and female** He created them... and they shall become *one flesh*" ([Genesis 1:27](https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-27.htm),[2:24](https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-24.htm)). However, because of man's rebellious heart, "God gave them over to **shameful lusts**... [exchanging] natural sexual relations for unnatural ones" ([Romans 1:26-27](https://biblehub.com/niv/romans/1.htm)). In response to those who continue in this practice—even while sharing a love for God—Jesus says, “If you love me, you will keep my commandments" ([John 14:15](https://biblehub.com/john/14-15.htm)).

### **09 Hasn't science disproved God?**
Some of the earliest scientific discoveries were made by avid Christians searching for God's fingerprints in nature (see [article](https://www.relevantmagazine.com/faith/9-groundbreaking-scientists-who-happened-be-christians/)). Today, atheists and skeptics alike make various attempts to disprove the existence of God and other "supernatural phenomena" by **marginalizing** biblical truth as mere fantasy or, at best, speculatory. However, the Bible claims that "since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities... have been clearly seen... so that people are without excuse" ([Romans 1:20](https://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm)). In reality, it takes just as much **faith not to believe in God**, but that would presuppose there's some form of objective truth.

### **10 Is there an eternity? (Who goes?)**
Many religions and cultures throughout the world possess a concept of heaven, or "paradise", in their folklore. Within the Judeo-Christian worldview, **God is the Creator of heaven** ([Genesis 1:1](https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm)), but more importantly, is who gets to spend eternity with Him. Jesus claimed to have come from the Father in heaven ([John 6:51](https://biblehub.com/john/6-51.htm)), and promises "eternal life" to all who believe and follow His teachings ([John 17:3](https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm)). There is **no other way** to the Father apart from Jesus, since He is "the way and the truth and the life" ([John 14:6](https://biblehub.com/john/14-6.htm)), the only son of God ([John 3:16](https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm); [Mark 3:17](https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm)) and bridge to eternity ([1 Timothy 2:5](https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-5.htm)).
